It was a fun week, the first week. I had the prior knowledge and I kind of knew all the knowledge shared this week; but the fun and productive part of this was when somewhere in the middle of the tutorial, a new subcategory and subject was shortly introduced and that made me to go and search about that topic and expand my understandings. An example would be when the professor told us to transfer our files from our localhost to our matrix account in a text format and not binary; That tempted me to search how a file like an image is transferred between devices as binary numbers and how specific programs and software can read this data and transform it to an image we see everyday.
Another thing I learned was how to work with Visual Studio. I have used simpler programs like Code Blocks but Visual Studio is just another level. One thing I still don’t get completely is the meaning of ‘Project’ and some other definitions in Visual Studio; I’m the guy that always wants to know why he is doing what he is doing.
One favor I have to ask from Mr. Robson is teaching us a little bit about Git and GitHub. Our workshops are uploaded in GitHub; I know there’s no need to know how to work with GitHub in this course but we all agree that it is one of the fundamentals that a programmer has to know about. That would be the best if we could learn a bit about it in the extra times of our class sessions.
Sincerely,
